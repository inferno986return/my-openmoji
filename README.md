# my-openmoji
A repo with my OpenMoji contributions. 

I want as many of these as possible to be available in the official OpenMoji repo, though some will be ineligible.

I don't consider myself to be an artist so many emoji I create, will be simple geometric designs adapted from other OpenMoji.

## Disclaimer

I cannot take responsibility for the use of these emoji, particularly the flags. Also some of these emoji are trademarked such as the pokeball.

## To-do:

### UK flags:
* UK county flags
