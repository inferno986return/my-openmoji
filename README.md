# my-openmoji
A repo with my OpenMoji contributions.

I want as many of these as possible to be available in the official OpenMoji repo, though some will be ineligible.

I don't consider myself to be an artist so many emoji I create, will be simple geometric designs adapted from other OpenMoji.

## Disclaimer

I cannot take responsibility for the use of these emoji, particularly the flags. Also some of these emoji are trademarked such as the pokéball.

## Almost done:

#### Pokéball ![Pokéball](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/openmoji_pokeball.png)
Watching *Detective Pikachu* has made me want to see a pokéball emoji. Use it to bring out your inner Pokéfan! However keep in mind that is a trademarked symbol.

#### City of London flag ![City of London flag](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/city_of_london_OpenMoji.png)
This design can be seen all over London's Square Mile which is home to iconic landmarks including St Paul's Cathedral, Temple Church and the London Mithraeum.

#### White Ensign flag ![White Ensign](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/white_ensign_OpenMoji.png)
The flag used to mark ships that part of the UK's naval fleet. The design has stuck with me after playing many hours of *Assassin's Creed: Black Flag*.

#### Inverted US flag ![Inverted US](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/USFlagDistressed_OpenMoji.png)
Technically a descrecation of the US flag, however many activists fly the flag inverted to symbolise distress.

#### Cornish flag ![Cornish ](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/CornishFlag_OpenMoji.png)
The St. Piran's flag is the symbol of Cornwall. A popular tourism county in England.

#### St. David's flag ![St. David's](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/StDavidFlag_OpenMoji.png)
The St. David's flag is the symbol of the patron saint of Wales. As well as being an alternate Welsh national flag.

#### US Thin Blue Line flag ![St. David's](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/USThinBlueLine_OpenMoji.png)
The Thin Blue Line is a symbol used by supporters of law enforcement to suggest they are the difference between law and chaos.

#### Molossia flag ![Molossia flag](https://github.com/inferno986return/my-openmoji/blob/master/png/MolossiaFlag_OpenMoji.png)
The flag of the Molossia micronation.
